# CISC375 Personal Website

## Overview

For our very first project in Web Development, we had to build our own individual personal website with using HTML, CSS, and Foundations. This included a home page, project page, resume, and a fun page. The home page is a brief introduction of who I am and what my goals are. The project page includes some of the projects that I have done from work and from my classes. The resume page is mirrored off my actual resume, but includes relevant information. Lastly, the fun page included some of the things that I like to do for fun, such as playing soccer and volleyball. This project worked very closely with the Foundation framework and also the accessibility of using an application on multiple devices, such as a phone or laptop.
