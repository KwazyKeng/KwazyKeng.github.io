                                This project was for my student worker job here on campus. Over the 2023 summer, my two coworkers and I removed huge bundles of dead coax
                                cables under the University of St. Thomas service tunnels. Coax is not used as much anymore, so there were bundles of dead coax cables up in the wire 
                                racks that were taking up space, so we had to come in to remove these cables. It was tedious, but also horrifying because one wrong move and 
                                we could have cut a live cable.

                                The purpose of this project was to use HTML forms and <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">P5.js</a> to enable a minimum of five input types
                                that control the canvas. It was recommended to use text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, select lists, and range sliders. To make it simpler, I used 
                                <a href="https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/" target="_blank">Tweakpane</a>, a Javascript library for changing certain parameters.

                                In CISC450, or Database, our final project consisted of creating a database using ER Diagramming, specifically <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/" target="_blank">
                                Crows Foot</a>, then populating the database using an <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-orm-the-meaning-of-object-relational-mapping-database-tools/" target="_blank">
                                ORM</a>, such as SQLAlchemy. Using these tools and Python, we created a simple Python script that had options to interact with the database, such as 
                                adding, removing, and editing items. My partner and I based our project off of a fisherman who wants to keep track of which reels, lines, and bait
                                are on which fishing poles.
